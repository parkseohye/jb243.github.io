Knowledge alone should be equal. [nate9389@gmail.com](mailto:nate9389@gmail.com)

## **1\. Before entering,**

This is a blog that started out as a diary (since 2009). However, through this blog, I became special and I wanted to communicate with the world through this blog. Then, while watching the match between Lee Se-dol and AlphaGo in 2016, I wanted to sketch a tree **about** human knowledge on this blog. And now, I would like to complete this project in earnest.


## **2\. Aim** 1**.** Realize the democratization of **knowledge**

○ Because education is no longer equal...

○ Because education no longer shows hope and dreams...

○ World is getting sick...

○ People often get frustrated because they find it difficult to study or spend a lot of time unnecessarily.

○ There were many cases where people didn't fully enjoy the pleasure of satisfying my desire for knowledge.

○ Strong measures need to be taken because enormous educational expenses make Korea sick.

○ **By** the way, will World's enthusiasm for education be lowered even if the final and best knowledge system for all fields is disclosed?

○ Advice **from** Avocado Addict

> In an era where AI dominates AI, the collapse of capitalism will accelerate and return to a self-sufficient society will proceed. For those who are lagging behind this era, democratization of knowledge is essential.


## **3\. Aim** 2**.** prevention of human cognitive saturation

○ The **arrival** of singularity: It is expected that the speed at which knowledge accumulates will be faster than the speed at which mankind understands it in the next 50 years.

○ Information expansion **:** There is still concern about explosive growth of IT and bio information.

○ Prevention of saturation of IT information **:** To cooperate with the IT industry

○ ○ Prevention of saturation of bio-information **:** To cooperate with the research community. It is expected to establish a gene-centered system.

○ How can one person collect all the knowledge of mankind?

○ **Answer 1**. **Crowd sourcing model\*\***:\*\* Build a business model for collecting and sharing knowledge by the majority

○ The most important conclusion you will find while studying economic history. The world has always demonstrated the law of stagnant harvests. The increase in population led to irreversible technological development and people's lives became richer. Then, the more knowledge you share, the more people gather, and the more knowledge you gather, the more knowledge you create?

○ Currently, known BM models such as Wikipedia, Github, and Naver Knowledgein are well known.

○ **Answer 2**. **AI Artificial Intelligence** Model**:** An idea of living and evolving writing

○ What I'm going to write is not a typical sentence. So I won't take away the jobs of writers.

○ **Answer 3.** **Social networking model\*\***:\*\* Building a network in the form of a point organization

○ The business model I think of is a form of branch organization. The vertical class adopted by large companies is a diagnosis that is not suitable for modern times when individuals' desire for self-realization has become stronger. We are planning a strategy in which one person becomes the center of networking by forming a one-on-one private contract rather than a vertical class. This is what I saw and felt at the startup that I was with from the beginning to the listing.

○ **Answer 4.** Insights on Knowledge

○ The core concept is based on the fact that there is a **small** percentage of the **total** knowledge.

○ You can think of the core concept as a point note for studying for the exam.

○ To understand the exact definition of the core concept, refer to the subprime [of](https://papago.naver.net/apis/site/proxy?url=https%3A%2F%2Fnate9389.tistory.com%2F2145%23%3A~%3Atext%3D%25E2%2591%25A1%25C2%25A0uncertainty%2520%25EB%2598%2590%25EB%258A%2594-%2Csurprisal%2C-%25E2%2597%258B%2520%25EC%25A0%2595%25EC%259D%2598%2520%253A%2520%25EC%25A3%25BC%25EC%2596%25B4%25EC%25A7%2584%2520%25EA%25B2%25BD%25EC%259A%25B0%25EC%259D%2598) information theory.



## **4\. Aim** 3**.**Attempt to preserve human knowledge

○ Immediately after the collapse of the ancient Roman Empire, the vast technology possessed by the Roman Empire was lost.

○ Humans are always facing extinction scenarios with high probability

○ Climate change

○ Nuclear war

○ Asteroid collision

○ Infectious disease outbreak

○ ○ The current blog has the nature of an attempt to preserve human knowledge when human knowledge is lost.

The animation of Dr. Stone also showed me a similar idea.

**Figure** 1**. Annie** Dr. Stone Illustration

○ As the teaching of the blockchain teaches, sharing knowledge makes knowledge forever.

○ Of course, we will definitely prevent the extinction of mankind and share scenarios in preparation for this.

○ Planning a complete and flawless data storage so that alien civilization can follow human knowledge in the distant future.

○ Or the process of preparing the seeds of knowledge to start civilization on another planet.

○ In other words, don't you need an encyclopedia of all things when you build civilization on an alien planet in hundreds of years?



## **5\. Aim** 4**.** Accelerating Knowledge Acquisition

○ The tempo of music is fast, and fast and repetitive videos like TikTok become popular, so wouldn't it be future-oriented to quickly acquire knowledge?

○ Low birth rate is a phenomenon experienced by all developed countries. *In an era when a **few** have to support **the majority**, the pace of knowledge acquisition must be accelerated.
