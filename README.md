## **Before entering,**

This is a blog that started out as a diary (since 2009). However, through this blog, I became special and I wanted to communicate with the world through this blog. Then, while watching the match between Lee Se-dol and AlphaGo in 2016, I wanted to sketch a tree **about** human knowledge on this blog. And now, I would like to complete this project in earnest.
